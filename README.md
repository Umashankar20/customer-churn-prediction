Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription Services
Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is essential for subscription-based services to sustain revenue and minimize customer turnover. 
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn using features such as
demographics, subscription details, and usage patterns.

Key Components:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected customer data, including demographics, subscription information, and usage patterns.
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the distribution of churn and analyzed correlations between features to understand data relationships.
Feature Engineering:

Created meaningful features from raw data to enhance model performance.
Model Building and Evaluation:

Used RandomForestClassifier for building the prediction model.
Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, achieving high accuracy and reliable predictions.
Visualization and Reporting:

Generated visualizations for churn distribution, correlation matrix, and feature importance.
Summarized findings and created a report to highlight key insights and model performance.

Key Insights
Churn Distribution: Visual analysis showed the proportion of customers who churned versus those who retained their subscriptions.
Correlation Analysis: Identified significant correlations between features and churn, aiding in feature selection.
Feature Importance: Highlighted top features contributing to churn prediction, helping in strategic decision-making for customer retention.
Conclusion
This project provides a robust approach to predict customer churn, enabling subscription-based services to take proactive measures in retaining customers. 
The model's reliability and insights can guide marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
